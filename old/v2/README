Communications lib v2:

This version is object orientated although not appropriate for a proper lib as it is made for testing and relies on Main too much.
In this version messages are JSON encoded and all messages sent are instances of the Message class.
The main problem with this version is that the stop function of the server has a nasty bit of exception checking where
the exception socket closed (Thrown by the accept method while blocking) is ignored. This is because closing a listening ServerSocket
can while the accept method is still blocking will throw the exception. The only fix that I'm aware of is to use ServerSocketChannel
which would require too much rewrite.
